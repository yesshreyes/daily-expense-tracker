## App Overview

**Smart Daily Expense Tracker** is a native Android module built with **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose** following a clean **MVVM** pattern.  
This module helps small business owners digitize daily expenses that are often lost on paper or WhatsApp â€” making cash-flow tracking simple, fast, and intelligent.

Core ideas:
- Fast expense capture (title, amount, category, optional notes, receipt image).
- Real-time daily totals and quick filtering.
- Short-term analytics (7-day mock reports) and easy export (PDF/CSV simulation).
